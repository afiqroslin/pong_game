# Pong game with Python and Turtle Graphic

This is my second project with Turtle Graphic on Python which is a classic Pong game!

If you have tried play the snake game I made in other repo the step to play this game is similar to that one. Either way, you can follow the following steps to play the game:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/afiqroslin/snake_game.git
```

Go into executable -> dist, double click on the application and the game is ready to play! No external software/ prerequisite is required.

**NOTE: The executable file can only run on Windows. For Linux, can run the apps by running the script on terminal.**


## Run using command prompt or terminal
For **Windows** open Command Prompt and for **Linux** open Terminal, and run these code:
```bash
    cd \{file_location}\
    python main.py
```
